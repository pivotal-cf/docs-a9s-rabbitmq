## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

a9s RabbitMQ for PCF enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated RabbitMQ servers and clusters. App developers can create instances of a RabbitMQ server or cluster using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) and bind these instances to an app.
Depending on your service plan, a service instance may be associated with a single, dedicated VM or a set of VMs that includes a RabbitMQ replica set cluster.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on VMs, only existing service instances use infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service instances are destroyed. With on-demand provisioning, the number of service instances is not limited by design.

For clustered data service plans, databases are distributed across multiple infrastructure availability zones (AZs). This enables short failover times and resilience against failures of individual infrastructure hosts or entire AZs.

### <a></a>Current Features

a9s RabbitMQ for PCF includes the following key features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| **On­-demand service instance provisioning** | a9s RabbitMQ for PCF deploys RabbitMQ instances automatically. Developers can provision a single-VM RabbitMQ server or a multi-VM RabbitMQ replica set using one command. |
| **Service instance isolation** | Each RabbitMQ server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure bad-neighborhood protection and align with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s RabbitMQ for PCF uses Cloud Foundry [application security groups (ASGs)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) to prevent network connections from unauthorized apps.
| **High availability** | a9s RabbitMQ for PCF ensures high availability using RabbitMQ replication.<br/><br/>The Consul-based internal DNS system provided by a9s Consul DNS for PCF ensures that the bound app always connects to a working node. |
| **Smoke tests** | A post-deployment, smoke-test errand runs basic tests against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly. |
| **Service instance capacity upgrade** | By updating your service plan, you can upgrade the RAM, CPU, and storage capacity for your RabbitMQ instances. |
| **Logging and monitoring** | Each RabbitMQ service instance provides log messages and RabbitMQ-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information. |
| **Deployment updater** | An updater errand updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s RabbitMQ for PCF service instances to their latest version. |
